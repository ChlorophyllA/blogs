# 2023.4.17 vite build blank pages
- Several days ago I met a wired problem. When built with vite by "npm run dev", my project turned out to be a blank page without any errors or warnings.
  I 've tried so many solutions, only to find that nothing changes.
- One saying attracted me. 
  It means it's normal to find my page blank when my project is built with vite and runs on localhost.
  Everything will be right when the project runs on the remote host.
  My instinct told me this is exactly the key. 
  But the case is I have to have preview on my localhost before it's deloyed on the remote host. Besides, I didn't find any corresponding solutions,
- Until I found that in file"package.json", the option for "dev" is "vite --host".
  I guess "--host" is the chief culprit so that I delete it. It turns out that I'm true.
